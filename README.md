# Motivation
I created the blog to house an example of the workflow that forms the foundation of a good investment process - as it pertains to etf portfolio management (whether active or passive). Ultimately, the goal is to build intuition in understanding how different components of the investment process fit together to improve the decision-making of anyone already working in the space or intending to.
