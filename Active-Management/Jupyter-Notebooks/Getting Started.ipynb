Unless you have compelling reasons to use different systems like say you want to have the ability to script Java or work at a company with restrictions on python systems, you probably want to use the Cpython system. I find it to be the most complete, up-to-date and roubst python implementation. \n",

This prebuilt approach makes it important to track dependencies(tracking if a battery is changed, broken or deprecated). To track these dependencies, my personal preference is to use package manager to help installing, updating and removing Python packages. My go-to is **conda**.\n"
